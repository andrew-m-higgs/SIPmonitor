  <h1>What is VoIPmonitor</h1>
  <p>VoIPmonitor is a SIP packet sniffer. Here is a good description
     directly from <a href='http://www.voipmonitor.org/' target='__new_page_voipmonitor'>
     their website</a>:<br />
     <blockquote><em style='font-size:85%'>VoIPmonitor is open source network packet sniffer with
     commercial frontend for SIP RTP RTCP and SKINNY(SCCP) VoIP protocols
     running on linux. VoIPmonitor is designed to analyze quality of VoIP
     call based on network parameters - delay variation and packet loss
     according to ITU-T G.107 E-model which predicts quality on MOS scale.
     Calls with all relevant statistics are saved to MySQL or ODBC
     database. Optionally each call can be saved to pcap file with either
     only SIP protocol or SIP/RTP/RTCP/T.38/udptl protocols. VoIPmonitor
     can also decode speech and play it over the commercial WEB GUI or
     save it to disk as WAV. Supported codecs are G.711 alaw/ulaw and
     commercial plugins supports G.722 G.729a G.723 iLBC Speex GSM Silk
     iSAC OPUS. VoIPmonitor is also able to convert T.38 FAX to PDF.</em></blockquote></p>

  <h1>What is SIPmonitor?</h1>
  <p>SIPmonitor is a fork of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/voipmonitorgui/">
     VoIPmonitor Free GUI</a> which was a start to a free
     (non-commercial) GUI for VoIPmonitor.</p>
  <p>The original source has been changed considerably and the data being
     displayed is now (hopefully) more useful. You can find out more about SIPmonitor
  at <a href="http://higgs.co.za" target='__new_page_higgs'>higgs.co.za</a>.</p>
  <p>This will hopefully be a useful replacement for those who cannot afford
  the commercial GUI.</>
